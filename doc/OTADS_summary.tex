This document presents the OTADS OpenTURNS module implementing the adaptive directional stratification algorithm for probability estimation.

This document is organized according to the OpenTURNS documentation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \itshape{Reference Guide} recalls a few theoretical elements,
    \item the \itshape{Use cases Guide}, composed with Python scripts (the Textual Interface language of OpenTURNS), is a quick How To,
    \item the \itshape{User Manual} is an exhaustive documentation of the objects  implemented within the $otads$ module,
    \item the \itshape{Examples Guide} provides example scripts illustrating features of the $otads$ module.
\end{itemize}
